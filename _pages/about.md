I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Dependability of Software-intensive Systems Group](https://www.jku.at/lit-cyber-physical-systems-lab/](https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/index.php) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), Germany. I completed my Ph.D. studies in computer science major software engineering at the [LIT Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://www.jku.at/lit-cyber-physical-systems-lab/) at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at/en) in 2023. My current research interests include software product lines, variability modeling, model transformations, software evolution, software consistency, and software development for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
