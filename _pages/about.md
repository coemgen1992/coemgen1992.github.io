I am a PhD student at the [LIT Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://www.jku.at/lit-cyber-physical-systems-lab/) at [Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU)](https://www.jku.at/), Austria. My current research interests include variability modeling, model transformations, software evolution and software development for Cyber-Physical Production Systems.
