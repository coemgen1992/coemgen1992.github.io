I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Dependability of Software-intensive Systems Group](https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/index.php) headed by [Prof. Dr. Ralf Reussner](https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/staff_ralf_reussner.php) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), Germany. I completed my Ph.D. studies in computer science major software engineering at the [LIT Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://www.jku.at/lit-cyber-physical-systems-lab/) at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at/en) in 2023. See my [CV](/files/CV_Kevin_Feichtinger.pdf) for details.

My research interests include software product lines, configurable systems, variability modeling, model transformations, software evolution, software consistency, and software development for Cyber-Physical Systems. 

Currently I am affiliated with the [CRC/SFB 1608 »Convide«](https://www.sfb1608.kit.edu/) where I research on the Consistency in the View-Based Development of Cyber-Physical Systems. Within the project, I coordinate the cross-project working group on "Notions and Definitions of Consistency".
