I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Dependability of Software-intensive Systems Group](https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/index.php) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), Germany. I completed my Ph.D. studies in computer science major software engineering at the [LIT Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://www.jku.at/lit-cyber-physical-systems-lab/) at [Johannes Kepler University Linz](https://www.jku.at/en) in 2023. My current research interests include software product lines, variability modeling, model transformations, software evolution, software consistency, and software development for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).

Transforming Variability Artifacts
======
Many different variability modeling approaches have been developed in the last 30 years. All of them have strengths and weaknesses and many have been shown to be at least useful for certain domains or use cases. However, it is difficult to understand the capabilities and differences of approaches to select the right approach for a specific use case. Thus, frequently new modeling approaches and custom artifacts for managing variability, e.g., domain-specific languages or spreadsheets, are developed. Therefore we developed TRAVART (TRAnsforming Variability ARTifacts), a transformation approach for variability artifacts (variability models as well as custom artifacts). We successfully transformed various existing variability artifacts from academia as well as industry, investigated the transformation impact on variability artifacts, and inspected the information lost during round-trip transformations. We showed that TRAVART supports and automates the transformation of different variability artifacts created using heterogeneous approaches. One can switch between variability artifacts of different types without losing already invested modeling efforts and compare the strengths and weaknesses of different variability modeling approaches. The work is summarized in the [PhD Thesis](https://epub.jku.at/obvulihs/content/titleinfo/9132023).
